The project is coded on Jupyter Notebook. VScode can open and run the .ipynb file.
For the input, since the project is about time series prediction, it 
is not necessary to run the file since the .ipynb has displayed both the input and output.

Libraries necessary to install:
numpy, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, statsmodels, scipy, sklearn, fbprophet, pystan.
